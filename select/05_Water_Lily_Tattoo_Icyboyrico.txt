Drinking out the bottle
Trynna make it to tomorrow
But my heart feels cold and broken
Cause this bitch she think I'm joking
When I text her bout my feelings
And she wanna come and text me
Ask me how the fuck I'm doing
Ask me how the fuck I'm feeling
When she riding other dick
And she found a new bitch
And I'm living by myself
With the two cats that we got
On our own
And they thinking that I'm chilling
On my own
But I'm grabbing up the gun
And aim that shit up to my dome
I don't think that I'm okay
I don't think that you will know
How many times I think about
Killing myself in my home
My momma
Yea she call me
Yea she text me
Ask me son yo how doing
I just ignore that shit
Then I scar my wrist
I don't wanna think about you
With a different person
But I think I gotta move on
So I fuck a couple bitches
And my heart is fucking ripping
Cause I'm failing at replacing
My poor baby as a person
So I'm trynna cope
But I don't know
What to do
Where to go
What to do
Where to go
